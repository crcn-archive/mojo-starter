Video tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/embed/FSq_yUbHkfQ

The **best** way to start using MojoJS is to download the [starter kit](https://github.com/mojo-js/mojo-starter). Before you
begin, **make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed**.

Once you've downloaded the starter kit, simply double-click the `server` file to start running your  application, then open up `http://localhost:8085` in your browser.

If you're comfortable with terminal, you can also run `npm install; npm start` in the application directory. 

Below are a list of available commands you can run for the starter kit.

#### npm install

Installs all dependencies for the starter kit

#### npm start

starts the development server on port `8085`

#### npm run build

bundles your application into one script

#### npm run hotswap

runs the [hotswap server](https://github.com/browsertap/ditto.js) on port `8090`. This script automatically reloads
your browser if any file changes locally.
